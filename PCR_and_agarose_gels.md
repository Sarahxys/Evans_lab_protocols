# PCR reaction

### Mix - per sample
- dH2O: 5.5ul
- buffer: 6.25ul
- Forward Primer: 0.28ul
- Reverse Primer: 0.28ul
- Taq: 0.05ul
- total = 12.36ul

### PCR mixture
1. Make a master mix
    - ex. if you are using the same primer combination (primer F1 x primer R1) for 7 DNA samples, make a master mix for 8 samples (7 for DNA samples, 1 for negative control). Calculate the total needed amount of each component (ex, total dH2O = 5.5 * 7 =38.5ul)
    - Take a 1.5ml tube from the pre-PCR drawer, label the tube. In the tube, make the master mix with the calculated amounts.  
 2. Take one panel of PCR tube from the pre-PCR drawer, label the tube (T0(negative control), sample A, sample B...ect). With a 20ul pipette, pipette 12.36ul of the mix into each PCR tube. You can use the same pipette tips to pipette the same master mix.
        - Do To last to make sure you have enough for each sample. It is okay if you only have a little bit (min=2ul) for To. 
 3. Other than the negative control tube, with a 10ul pipette, add 0.75ul of DNA into the corresponding PCR tube. Ex. pipette 0.75ul of sample A DNA into the PCR tube labelling sample A. Change pipette tips for each DNA sample.
        - make sure there is sample in the pipette tips when you pipette.
        - pipette up and down several times after adding DNA to ensure you get most of the DNA out of the tip.

General tips:
        - In the tray holding the extracted DNA samples, move the one that you are done with one space up so that you know it is done.
        - In the tip box, always start with the first tips of a row so that you know which PCR tube you are at. 
 
### Running PCR reaction
1. Turn on the Mastercycler machine. Login with the user name and password provided on the sticker note. 
2. Put the PCR tubes into the wells. Close the lip firmly. 
3. Select a saved PCR cycle to run or set up your own PCR cycle. A typic cycle would involve:
4. Exit the cycle editing screen. Select the cycle then press start. Select 'Tube' then press OK to start running. 
5. After the reaction finished, the machine will ask you to press "Enter". Press "enter" and push the lip open.
6. One a piece of tape, put the information of your PCR product including the name of the reaction(ex. PCR), primer used(psex_xb_F1 x psex_xb_R1), name of the species(xborealis), date (Nov 5 2017).
7. Put the tape on the tubes and put the plate holding the PCR tubes into the fridge.

# Checking the present of PCR product with 1% gel

1 gram of agarose plus 100 mls volume of TBE buffer (adjust if running a large gel)

Microwave until just boiling. Then swirl and microwave again.  THen add 3ul of Ethidium Bromide (which is toxic - use gloves).

Load on negative (black) side because DNA is negatively charged.  Run at 100 mA for 30 mins 

#### Making a 1% gel step by step intruction
1. Put the 500mL glass vase on scale to zero it
2. Add 1g of agarose powder to the glass vase on scale
3. Get 100ml of TBE buffer using a graduated cylinder (use graduated cylinder from the EtBr contaminated zone).
3. Pour the TBE buffer into the glass vase. 
4. Microwave the mixture until just boiling. Then take it out the microware and swirl the mixture. Microware the mixture again for 15-20sec.
5. Sit the glass vase containing the mixture on the counter to allow it to cool down for 15-20min.
6. Add 3ul of Ethidium Bromide.
7. Set up the gel tray and pour the mixture.
