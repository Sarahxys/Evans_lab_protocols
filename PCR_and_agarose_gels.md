# How to make a 1% gel

1 gram of agarose plus 100 mls volume of TBE buffer (adjust if running a large gel)

Microwave until just boiling. Then swirl and microwave again.  THen add 3ul of Ethidium Bromide (which is toxic - use gloves).

Load on negative (black) side because DNA is negatively charged.  Run at 100 mA for 30 mins 

#### Making a 1% gel step by step intruction
1. Put the 500mL glass vase on scale to zero it
2. Add 1g of agarose powder to the glass vase on scale
3. Get 100ml of TBE buffer using a graduated cylinder (from the EtBr contaminated zone).
3. Pour the TBE buffer into the glass vase. 
4. Microwave the mixture until just boiling. Then take it out the microware and swirl the mixture. Microware the mixture again for 15-20sec.
5. Sit the glass vase containing the mixture on the counter to allow it to cool down for 15-20min.
6. Add 3ul of Ethidium Bromide.
7. Set up the gel tray and pour the mixture.
