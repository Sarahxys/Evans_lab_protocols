# Designing Primers
Primer design guideline: 
-  primer length: 18-24
- melting temperature (Tm): 50-60°C, within 5°C of each other. If the Tm of your primer is very low, try to find a sequence with more GC content, or extend the length of the primer a little.
- GC content: around 50% (40-60%), start and end with one G/C to promote stability
- Typically, 3 to 4 nucleotides are added 5’ of the restriction enzyme site in the primer to allow for efficient cutting.
- Try to avoid regions of secondary structure, and have a balanced distribution of GC-rich and AT-rich domains.
- Try to avoid runs of 4 or more of one base, or dinucleotide repeats (for example, ACCCC or ATATATAT).
- Avoid intra-primer homology (more than 3 bases that complement within the primer) or inter-primer homology (forward and reverse primers having complementary sequences).  These circumstances can lead to self-dimers or primer-dimers instead of annealing to the desired DNA sequences.
