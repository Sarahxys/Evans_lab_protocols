# Designing Primers
Primer design guideline: 
-  primer length: 18-24
- melting temperature (Tm): 50-60°C, within 5°C of each other. If the Tm of your primer is very low, try to find a sequence with more GC content, or extend the length of the primer a little.
- GC content: around 50% (40-60%), start and end with one G/C to promote stability
- Typically, 3 to 4 nucleotides are added 5’ of the restriction enzyme site in the primer to allow for efficient cutting.
- Try to avoid regions of secondary structure, and have a balanced distribution of GC-rich and AT-rich domains.
- Try to avoid runs of 4 or more of one base, or dinucleotide repeats (for example, ACCCC or ATATATAT).
- Avoid intra-primer homology (more than 3 bases that complement within the primer) or inter-primer homology (forward and reverse primers having complementary sequences).  These circumstances can lead to self-dimers or primer-dimers instead of annealing to the desired DNA sequences.



# This is how we order primers

Primers are ordered from this website 'https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/pc/ui/tube-home/standard'. Login with lab account and password. Their website might change once in a while. 

To get to primer ordering page, select taps following this path: product -> Custome Product -> Order Oliges and Peptides -> Oligos and Probes -> DNA Oligos in Tubes -> Order. If you have the primer information entered in a Multiple Entry Template(provided by Sigma), choose "upload and copy & paste".If you dont, select "manual entry". 4 essential components:
  - oligo name: select a name for the primer that make sense for your (ex, nr5a1_ex1_for1, nr5a1 is the name of gene the primer is for, ex1 indicate exon1 of the gene, for1 indicate forward primer 1). 
  - seqenuence(5' to 3'): the input primer sequence need to start from the 5' to 3' of the primer (not the 5' to 3' of the sequence that you are trying to amplify)
  - scale (micro mole): 0.025
  - purification: PR1

Blah blah

# This is how we make a 20uM stock of primers from the 100uM stock
